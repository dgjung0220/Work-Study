### CHAPTER 0 â€” Points and Lines
This is a tutorial on the mathematical tools used in Three Dimensional Computer Graphics (3D Graphics). A 3D graphics program builds a scene composed of three dimensional objects in three dimensional space. Then two dimensional images are produced from the 3D scene. The scene is represented as a data structure in computer memory. The 2D image is typically the picture on the face of a computer monitor.

The 3D objects are composed of points, lines, and polygons. You know what these are, but so that we can start from a common ground, this chapter reviews these concepts and introduces some of the vocabulary of computer graphics.

#### Chapter Topics:
- Points
- Lines
- Triangles
- Vectors
- Representing points, lines, and vectors

Two fundamental objects in geometry are points and lines. What are they?

#### QUESTION 1:
What is a point? (Think about this question before you go on!)
#### Answer :
A point is a location in space.

#### Picture of a Point
A geometrical point is a location in space. It has no other characteristics. It has no length, width, or thickness. It is pure location.

The above answer would not help you if you somehow did not already understand the concept of "point". The phrase "location in space" designates the same concept as the word "point". The definition cannot convey a concept you do not already have.

In geometry, the word point is not defined. It is one of the undefined primitives that are used to define other objects. Instead of defining "point" books give examples and hope that you somehow build up the concept from them.

At right is a picture that I hope will clarify this. The picture shows two cupolas on top of a building. The picture is 2D, but think about the actual 3D building. Focus on the spike (finial) at the top of the closest cupola.

What is the location of the very top of the spike? On the scale of the building, the sharp end of the spike defines an exact location. We can conceptualize that location as a point.
